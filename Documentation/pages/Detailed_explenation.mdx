# Project File Documentation

## 1. `can_commands.py`
- **Purpose:** Manages CAN bus communication for device interaction.
- **Key Functions:** Sends CAN messages with specific commands and data.
- **Integration:** Used by various modules for hardware control.

## 2. `chilibot.sqlite`
- **Purpose:** Stores sensor data and command logs.
- **Tables:** `sensor_values` and `command_log`.
- **Integration:** Accessed by scripts for data storage and retrieval.

## 3. `dashboard.py`
- **Purpose:** User interface for system monitoring and control.
- **Integration:** Displays data from the database; may send control commands.

## 4. `db.py`
- **Purpose:** Handles database operations.
- **Functionality:** Creates and manages the database schema.
- **Integration:** Central to data storage and management.

## 5. `main.py`
- **Purpose:** Entry point of the application.
- **Functionality:** Starts sensor scheduler and manages scheduled tasks.

## 6. `pump_valve_scheduler.py`
- **Purpose:** Schedules and controls pump and valve operations.
- **Functionality:** Operates the pump and valve based on a set schedule.
- **Integration:** Uses `can_commands` for hardware control; `schedule` for timing.

## 7. `sensor_scheduler.py`
- **Purpose:** Regularly schedules sensor readings.
- **Functionality:** Reads various sensors and saves data to the database.
- **Integration:** Relies on `can_commands` for sensor data and `db` for data storage.

## 8. `grow_light_scheduler.py`
- **Purpose:** Manages scheduling for grow lights.
- **Functionality:** Turns grow lights on and off at specified times.
- **Integration:** Utilizes `can_commands` for controlling grow lights; `schedule` for timing.

### How They Work Together
- Sensors and actuators are controlled via `can_commands.py`.
- `chilibot.sqlite` serves as the central data repository.
- `dashboard.py` provides a user interface for real-time monitoring and control.
- `db.py` manages data storage and retrieval operations.
- `main.py` orchestrates the operation of the entire system, including scheduling tasks.
- Scheduling scripts (`pump_valve_scheduler.py`, `sensor_scheduler.py`, `grow_light_scheduler.py`) automate various system operations based on set schedules.
