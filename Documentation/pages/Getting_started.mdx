# Getting Started with Chilibot

Welcome to the exciting journey of setting up your Chilibot! This guide will walk you through the initial steps to get your automated chili plant growing bot up and running.

## Step 1: Assemble Your Hardware

Before diving into the software, make sure your Chilibot hardware is assembled correctly.

1. **Arduino Uno Setup:** Ensure that your Arduino Uno is properly connected to the necessary sensors and actuators.
2. **Raspberry Pi Configuration:** Set up your Raspberry Pi and ensure it is ready to communicate with the Arduino Uno.
3. **CAN Bus Connection:** Connect the Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi using the CAN bus system for seamless communication.
4. **Plant Bed Assembly:** Set up the adjustable plant bed and place it in the desired location.

## Step 2: Arduino Code Setup

Now it's time to program your Arduino Uno. Below is the code to for the arduino.

## Step 3 Raspberry Pi Software Installation

    Download the Software: Download the Chilibot software package onto your Raspberry Pi.
    Install Dependencies: Install any required libraries or dependencies for the software to run smoothly.
    Configure Settings: Adjust the settings in the software to match your environmental conditions and preferences.

## Step 4: Connect and Test

    Power Up: Power up both Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi.
    Run a Test: Execute a basic test to ensure that the hardware components are interacting correctly.
    Debug if Necessary: Troubleshoot any issues that arise during the test.

## Step 5: Plant Your Chilies

    Prepare Soil: Ensure the soil in the plant bed is suitable for chili plants.
    Plant Chili Seedlings: Carefully place your chili seedlings in the bed.
    Adjust the Light: Position the adjustable light source to provide optimal lighting to your plants.

## Step 6: Monitor and Enjoy

    Monitor: Regularly check the Chilibot interface on the Raspberry Pi for updates on your plant's condition.
    Adjust Settings as Needed: Tweak the settings based on the feedback and growth of your chili plants.
    Enjoy the Process: Watch as your chili plants grow, aided by the automation and care provided by Chilibot.

Congratulations, you have successfully set up your Chilibot! Happy growing and enjoy the fruits of your labor!
