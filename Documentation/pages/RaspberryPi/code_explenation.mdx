# 🌱 Chilibot RaspberryPi Documentation 🤖

## Overview
This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Chilibot project's code structure and functionality. The project comprises several Python modules, each handling specific tasks in the automated gardening system.

### 🗂️ File Structure

1. **grow_light_scheduler.py** 🌟
   - Manages the scheduling for the grow light.
   - Contains functions to turn the light on and off based on predefined schedules.

2. **pump_valve_scheduler.py** 💧
   - Handles the scheduling for the water pump and solenoid valve.
   - Includes functions to activate or deactivate the water systems at specific times.

3. **sensor_scheduler.py** 🌡️
   - Responsible for collecting and processing data from various sensors.
   - Schedules periodic sensor readings and data logging.

4. **can_commands.py** 🚌
   - Contains definitions and functions for CAN bus communication.
   - Facilitates sending and receiving CAN messages to/from various components.

5. **dashboard.py** 📊
   - Implements the main user interface for the system, this is the home page of the user interface.
   - Displays real-time data, logs, and controls for the system.

6. **db.py** 📚
   - Manages database interactions.
   - Stores, retrieves, and manages data like sensor readings and system states.

7. **start.py** 🚀
   - Main entry point for the application.
   - Initializes and starts all services, schedulers, and the dashboard.

### 🏁 Getting Started

To get the system up and running: 
1. activate the environment by running `source env/bin/activate`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run `start.py` to initialize and start all components of the Chilibot system.
4. Access the dashboard located at http://192.168.2.5:8501/` to monitor and control the system.

### 🛠️ Customization and Expansion

- Modify the scheduler files (`grow_light_scheduler.py`, `pump_valve_scheduler.py`, `sensor_scheduler.py`) to change the timing and logic of operations.
- Update `can_commands.py` for changes in CAN communication protocols or message formats.
- Enhance `dashboard.py` to add more features to the user interface.
- Adjust `db.py` for any changes in data storage requirements or database schema.
