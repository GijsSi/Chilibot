# About Chilibot

## Introduction

Chilibot is my final project for Hogeschool van Amsterdam, a blend of technology and gardening. Created as a standalone endeavor, it reflects my learning and application of skills in a practical, impactful way.

## The Project

Chilibot, developed entirely by me, integrates Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi to automate the cultivation of chili plants. It's designed to simplify plant care, employing sensors and actuators to maintain optimal growing conditions.

### Key Features:
- Automated Watering System
- Temperature and Air Humidity Monitoring
- Soil Moisture Detection
- Adjustable Plant Bed for optimal light exposure

## Objective

The goal of Chilibot is to offer an efficient, user-friendly solution for chili plant cultivation. It aims to reduce manual labor and optimize resource use, making plant care accessible to everyone from hobbyists to professional growers.

## Development

The development of Chilibot involved programming, electronics, and a bit of creativity. Each feature was carefully implemented to ensure functionality and user experience, keeping in mind the diverse needs of chili plants.

## Closing Thoughts

As a project for Hogeschool van Amsterdam, Chilibot represents my journey in applying theoretical knowledge to a tangible, real-world application. It's a step towards more innovative and eco-friendly gardening solutions.

Thank you for exploring Chilibot â€“ where technology meets the art of gardening.
